# SightlessGuide: Navigate, Detect, Read, and Call - All by Voice

## Overview

**SightlessGuide** is a React Native Android application developed to enhance the independence and safety of visually impaired individuals. By leveraging advanced technologies like YOLO v8, ResNet50, and voice recognition modules, the app offers real-time object detection, currency recognition, navigation, weather updates, and text scanningâ€”all controlled via voice commands.

## Features

### Real-time Object Detection
- **Technology:** YOLO v8
- **Dataset:** Open Image V7
- **Functionality:** Continuously captures images to identify and describe objects in real-time, providing auditory feedback to the user.

### Real-time Currency Detection
- **Technology:** ResNet50
- **Functionality:** Recognizes and describes different currency notes, providing details via voice output.

### Real-time Navigation
- **Functionality:** Provides route guidance from source to destination based on voice input. Automatically retrieves the user's current location when the navigation module is activated.
- **Voice Control:** Allows users to set destinations and receive real-time route guidance and alerts through voice commands.

### Weather Updates
- **Functionality:** Retrieves and analyzes current weather data based on the user's location, delivering weather reports and suggestions via voice.

### Text Scanner
- **Functionality:** Activated by double-tapping, this feature captures images of text, analyzes and extracts the text, then converts it to speech and reads it aloud.

### Emergency Contacts
- **Registration:** Facilitators register emergency contacts during the initial setup.
- **Voice Calling:** Users can call emergency contacts by name using voice commands.

### Voice Command Control
- **Module Switching:** Users can switch between modules (object detection, navigation, weather updates, etc.) using voice commands.
- **Automatic Location Retrieval:** The app automatically retrieves the user's current location when the navigation module is activated.

## Usage

### Registration
Facilitators assist users in registering by entering personal details and adding up to 4 emergency contacts. Once registration is confirmed, users can explore the app's features.

### Object Detection
Activate the object detection module through a voice command. The app will continuously capture images and describe detected objects via voice.

### Currency Detection
Activate the currency detection module by saying the relevant voice command. The app will capture and identify currency notes, providing descriptions through voice.

### Navigation
Activate the navigation module by voice. Set your destination using a voice command. The app will automatically fetch your current location, calculate the route, and provide guidance and alerts.

### Weather Updates
Activate the weather report module via voice. The app will retrieve current weather data, analyze it, and provide a verbal weather report with suggestions.

### Text Scanner
Double-tap to activate the text scanner. The app will capture an image of the text, analyze and extract the text, and read it aloud.

### Emergency Contacts
Register emergency contacts during the initial registration. Call emergency contacts by saying their name using a voice command.
